Ghosts: Aether or Void
    - Thinks void, as is lack of something

    - or both Aether as nature and Void as affinity.
        - Ghosts will have one of them as depending on how it came to be..
        - Neutral affinity monsters can gain "ghost" status by aquring void affinity, no need for death.
        - Death causes a chance for monster to "return" with "Aether" nature and their original affinity.
        - Aether + Neutral affinity monster should be available natrually. 
        - Brutality sould result in a hostile ghost with Aether + Void affinity, very dangerous.
    
    - Worldbuilding: Death is seen as a change of life, revered and cherished, not something to dread.
        - Peacfull passing releases the aether/soul back to nature, many finds themself living as ghosts for a long time before dispering willingly.
            - Settelments lives alongside these ghost, having graves and memorials to celebrate their ghostly loved ones.
                - mischiveous ghots of the young.
                - protective ghosts of warriors.
                - ghost helping crops grow.

        - A brutal passing will almost always disperse the soul of the dying immideatly.
            - If it does not, a vindictive Aether/Void monster is created.
